# x-card

To use `x-card` webcomponent, simply include

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@patarapolw/make-html-x-card"></script>
```

To support old browsers, you might also need [@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs)

```html
<script src="./node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@patarapolw/make-html-x-card"></script>
```

This is a part of <https://github.com/patarpolw/make-html>.
